# So, you want to run a multiverse analysis

Here is a *very* quick tutorial to get you started. No previous experience with R is assumed, though it will help to know the basics (Software carpentry has an amazing course here https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/). I try to keep things simple and do my best to explain things throughout.

If anything is unclear, comment or raise an issue on the github repository and I'll try to help :)

You can find the youtube recording here:

The data were taken from Data from the 16PF  https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/

Want to run a reliability multiverse on your task data? Check out my paper "Exploring reliability heterogeneity with multiverse analyses: Data processing decisions unpredictably influence measurement reliability" https://psyarxiv.com/y6tcz
